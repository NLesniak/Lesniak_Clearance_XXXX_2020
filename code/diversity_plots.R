# diversity vs colonization

#alpha diversity
communities colonized to higher levels have lower diversity (alpha)
	association between cfu and alpha
	cfu vs # of otus
	shared otus?
#beta diversity
highly infected communities are most different than untreated
	separation between untreated mice and all the highly infected communities (>1e6)
communities that recover/elimnate cdifficile are more diverse
	difference in diversity between highly infected 
more change w/low diversity?
more change with high cfu?

need to remove dependence of daily sampling?
