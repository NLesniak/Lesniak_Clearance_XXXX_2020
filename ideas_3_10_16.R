-inverse simpson, diversity over time, average per cage and time on x
  summary.single, read into R, combine
  
-think of hypotheses first 

  fxn for cage # and days avail   
  
  lost of cages and days save to lists 
  series of for loops
  
  do abx over that
  write a function that takes in treatment group, cage num and days in the cage
  that will then loop through and take simpson mean of each sample in the cage per day
  and either plot that for each day, or save it to a list that we can then plot
  
  treatment group > cages >days 
  either plot right away or save to lists 
  
-look at community over time vs cdiff over time

-abundance things 
  
-then go to dynamics and stuff 
  go back and look at stein paper 
  get table of abundance and how much/if they chance
  rank abundance 
  
could do machine learning and classify if cdiff stuck around or not, if they were  susceptible community
do feature selection and see what bugs are susceptible/permissible 
or look for whats missing 

ask jenior about his minimal cdiff community things, see if we find specific bugs do they correlate with metabolic data

read some papers in the field
get U grant
