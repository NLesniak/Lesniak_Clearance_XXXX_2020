-look at shannon diversity over time for 10 days
  might not show anything interesting 
  
-look at community over time vs cdiff over time

-abundance things 
  
-then go to dynamics and stuff 
  go back and look at stein paper 
  get table of abundance and how much/if they chance
  rank abundance 
  
could do machine learning and classify if cdiff stuck around or not, if they were  susceptible community
do feature selection and see what bugs are susceptible/permissible 
or look for whats missing 

ask jenior about his minimal cdiff community things, see if we find specific bugs do they correlate with metabolic data

read some papers in the field
get U grant
