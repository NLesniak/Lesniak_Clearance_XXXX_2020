What is my quesiton? -Nick

diversity does not predict colonization
	community members will best predict colonization

communities colonized to higher levels have lower diversity (alpha)
	association between cfu and alpha
highly infected communities are most different than untreated
	separation between untreated mice and all the highly infected communities (>1e6)
communities that recover/elimnate cdifficile are more diverse
	difference in diversity between highly infected 
each community (abx) will have a unique network
	by correlation
	by ML - RF will perform best when applied to a single treatment

how does diversity affect colonization
		cfu vs # of otus
		cfu vs rel abun
	shared otus?
	beta diversity
		more change w/low diversity?
		more change with high cfu?
association between microbes and level?
	day x to day x?
	day x to day x+1?
predict colonization level 
	from day 0?
	from prior day?

need to remove dependence of daily sampling? antibiotic treatment?


amova/permanova - difference in cloud of points in nmds


Met with Pat 1/17/18
	check abundance/
	Do day 10 look like Day -2 (before abx)?
		are most similar the recovered ones?
	Split analysis by abx/dose/recovery (days between abx and cdiff challenge)
	Resistance more similar than colonized?
	Start with high does and low recovery
		then look at how modulating the dose/recovery affects 
		train model with low recovery and test with high recovery
	Show different context of day 0
	AKP - more ways to be healthy?
	compare differences in metro recovery 
		how do susceptibility break points compare?

				"Luo et al. (3) questioned this finding using the Clark implementation of CCM (version 1.0 of the multispatial CCM package).* This version of the CCM code, which has since been debugged by Clark, unfortunately contains errors that are not in the original rEDM software package that Tsonis et al. used.† Thus, though well-intentioned, the Luo et al. (3) analysis is incorrect."

			"Any algorithm for inferring ecological interactions must overcome three major obstacles: 1) a correlation between the abundances of two species does not imply that those species are interacting, 2) the sum constraint on the relative abundances obtained from metagenomic studies makes it difficult to infer the parameters in timeseries models, and 3) errors due to experimental uncertainty, or mis-assignment of sequencing reads into operational taxonomic units, bias inferences of species interactions due to a statistical problem called “errors-in-variables”. Learning Interactions from MIcrobial Time Series (LIMITS), that overcomes these obstacles. LIMITS uses sparse linear regression with boostrap aggregation to infer a discrete-time Lotka-Volterra model for microbial dynamics"
