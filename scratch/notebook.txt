What is my quesiton? -Nick

association between microbes and level?
	day x to day x?
	day x to day x+1?
predict colonization level 
	from day 0?
	from prior day?
communities colonized to higher levels have lower diversity (alpha)
	association between cfu and alpha
highly infected communities are most different than untreated
	separation between untreated mice and all the highly infected communities (>1e6)
communities that recover/elimnate cdifficile are more diverse
	difference in diversity between highly infected 
each community (abx) will have a unique network
	by correlation
	by ML - RF will perform best when applied to a single treatment

how does diversity affect colonization
	cfu vs # of otus
	cfu vs rel abun
shared otus?
beta diversity
	more change w/low diversity?
	more change with high cfu?

	diversity does not predict colonization
		community members will best predict colonization

need to remove dependence of daily sampling?
