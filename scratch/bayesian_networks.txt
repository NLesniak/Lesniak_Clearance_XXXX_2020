1. Longitudinal Prediction of the Infant Gut Microbiome with Dynamic Bayesian Networks. Michael J. McGeachie, Joanne E. Sordillo, Travis Gibson, George M. Weinstock, Yang-Yu Liu, Diane R. Gold, Scott T. Weiss & Augusto Litonjua. Scientific Reports volume 6, Article number: 20359 (2016). https://www.nature.com/articles/srep20359#ref27
	Used a two-stage dynamic bayesian network (only considers current and one day prior sample)
		assumes all t+1 time points are independent of t-1 and earlier
	Used CGBayesNets (MatLab)
	Created directed network and made predictions on changes in community
		although not sure some of network makes sense
			i.e. Fuso > postconceptional age when sample obtained

2. Dynamic interaction network inference from longitudinal microbiome data. Jose Lugo-Martinez, Daniel Ruiz-Perez, Giri Narasimhan & Ziv Bar-Joseph. Microbiome volume 7, Article number: 54 (2019) https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-019-0660-3
	develop own Dynamic bayesian network pipeline, uses CGBayesNets (matlab)
	https://github.com/jlugomar/longitudinal_microbiome_analysis_public
		1. spline estimate - convert discrete temporal sampling to continuous samples
		2. align data via dynamic time warping
		3. dynamic bayesian network (two stage)
			only use previous (t) and current (t+1) time points
	test through cross validation
		leave out a subject, generate the model, predict abundance
		compared to baseline (no change in abundance) and other methods

> Spieceasi - one for current and one for past time point? to do intra and inter?


3. Inferring Relationships in Microbiomes from Signed Bayesian Networks. IEEE. Musfiqur Rahman Sazal ; Daniel Ruiz-Perez ; Trevor Cickovski ; Giri Narasimhan.
	combine the sign of the correlations from Co-occurence networks with BNs to give more informative inference
	Conference representation, but later published [2]

4. The lung microbiota in early rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmunity. Jose U. Scher, Vijay Joshua, Alejandro Artacho, Shahla Abdollahi-Roodsaz, Johan Öckinger, Susanna Kullberg, Magnus Sköld, Anders Eklund, Johan Grunewald, Jose C. Clemente, Carles Ubeda, Leopoldo N. Segal & Anca I. Catrina. Microbiome volume 4, Article number: 60 (2016)
	Cross-sectional lung microbiota
	Used bnlearn hill climbing  with "Spearman’s correlation p-value greater than 0.05 or Spearman’s correlation coefficient absolute value lower than 0.5" and focused on subnetwork using Markov blanket of node (parents and children of node)

5. Rapid Inference of Direct Interactions in Large-Scale Ecological Networks from Heterogeneous Microbial Sequencing Data. Cell Systems Report| Volume 9, ISSUE 3, P286-296.e8, September 25, 2019. Janko Tackmann, João Frederico Matias Rodrigues, Christian von Mering. DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2019.08.002
	created pipeline in julia with walkthrough
		Flashwave https://github.com/meringlab/FlashWeave.jl
	Probabalistic graphical models
	Similar to Spieceasi
	Also compares to mLDM (metagenomic Lognormal-Dirichlet-Multinomial (mLDM), a hierarchical Bayesian model with sparsity constraints, compares to Spieceasi but with added environmental factor) and eLSA

> Use conditional dependence to differentiate between direct and indirect associations, 

6.  Structural and functional changes in the gut microbiota associated to Clostridium difficile infection. Ana E. Pérez-Cobas, Alejandro Artacho, Stephan J. Ott, Andrés Moya, María J. Gosalbes and Amparo Latorre. Front. Microbiol., 04 July 2014 | https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2014.00335
	comparing pre, during and post anitibiotics (
	2 - 7 timepoints per patient, 5 patients CD- and 3 patients CD +


7. The Monoclonal Antitoxin Antibodies (Actoxumab–Bezlotoxumab) Treatment Facilitates Normalization of the Gut Microbiota of Mice with Clostridium difficile Infection. Mária Džunková, Giuseppe D'Auria, Hua Xu, Jun Huang, Yinghua Duan, Andrés Moya, Ciarán P. Kelly, and Xinhua Chen. Front Cell Infect Microbiol. 2016; 6: 119. doi: 10.3389/fcimb.2016.00119
	used bnlearn 
		Spearman correlation >0.3 and < −0.3
		among the bacterial OTUs (average proportion >0.02%)
		vertices "represent mutual associations (not causality)"
