## Abstract

The gut bacterial community prevents pathogens from colonizing the intestine. Previous studies have associated specific bacteria with eliminating *Clostridioides difficile* colonization across different community perturbations. However, those bacteria alone have been unable to eliminate *C. difficile* colonization. To elucidate the changes necessary to eliminate colonization, we investigated how changes in bacterial abundance compare between communities able and unable to clear *C. difficile* colonization. We treated mice with titrated doses of antibiotics prior to *C. difficile* challenge which resulted in no colonization, clearance of colonization, or persistent colonization. Previously, we observed that clindamycin-treated mice were susceptible to colonization but spontaneously cleared *C. difficile*. Therefore, we investigated if mice treated with other antibiotics would show the same result. We found reduced doses of cefoperazone and streptomycin permitted colonization and then clearance of *C. difficile*. In mice able to clear colonization, we found each antibiotic caused specific community changes and resulted in different predicted interactions with *C. difficile*. Clindamycin treatment led to a bloom in populations related to *Enterobacteriaceae* and clearance of *C. difficile* was concurrent with the reduction of those blooming populations and the restoration of community members related to the *Porphyromonadaceae* and *Bacteroides*. Cefoperazone created a susceptible community characterized by a drastic reduction in the community diversity, interactions, and a sustained increase in abundance of many facultative anaerobes, including *Enterobacteriaceae*. Lastly, clearance in streptomycin-treated mice was associated with the recovery of multiple members of the *Porphyromonadaceae*, with little overlap in OTUs observed in the clindamycin treatment. Further elucidation of how *C. difficile* colonization is eliminated from different gut bacterial communities will improve *C. difficile* infection treatments.

## Importance

The community of microorganisms, known as the microbiota, in our intestines prevents pathogens, such as *C. difficile*, from establishing themselves and causing infection. This is known as colonization resistance. However, when a person takes antibiotics, their gut microbiota is disturbed. This disruption allows *C. difficile* to colonize. *C. difficile* infections (CDI) are primarily treated with antibiotics, which frequently leads to recurrent infections because the microbiota have not yet returned to a resistant state. The infection cycle ends when the fecal microbiota from a resistant person are transplanted into the susceptible person. Although this treatment is highly effective, we do not understand the mechanism of resistance. We hope to improve the treatment of CDI through elucidating how the bacterial community eliminates *C. difficile* colonization. We found *C. difficile* was able to colonize susceptible mice but was spontaneously eliminated in an antibiotic-treatment specific manner. These data indicate each community had different requirements for clearing colonization. Understanding how different communities clear colonization will reveal targets to improve CDI treatments.

## Introduction

A complex consortium of bacteria and microbes that inhabits our gut, known as the microbiota, prevent pathogens from colonizing and causing disease. This protection, known as colonization resistance, is mediated through many mechanisms such as activating host immune responses, competing for nutrients, producing antimicrobials, and contributing to the maintenance of the mucosal barrier [@ducarmon2019]. However, perturbations to the intestinal community or these functions opens the possibility that a pathogen can colonize [@britton2012]. For example, the use of antibiotics perturb the gut microbiota and can lead to *Clostridioides difficile* infection (CDI).

CDI is especially problematic due to its burden on the healthcare system [@lessa2015; @zimlichman2013]. *C. difficile* can cause severe disease, such as toxic megacolon, nosocomial diarrhea, and death [@spigaglia2016]. CDI is primarily treated with antibiotics [@dieterle2019]. CDIs recalcitrant to antibiotics are eliminated by restoring the community with a fecal microbiota transplant (FMT), returning the perturbed community to a healthier protective state [@juul2018; @seekatz2014]. However, FMTs are not always effective against CDI and have the risk of transferring a secondary infection [@patron2017; @defilipp2019]. Therefore, we need to better understand how the microbiota clears the infection to develop more effective treatments.

Previous research has shown that the microbiota affects *C. difficile* colonization. Mouse models have identified potential mechanisms of colonization resistance such as bile salt metabolism and nutrient competition [@buffie2015; @fletcher2018; @reed2020; @jenior2017]. However, studies that have restored those functions were unable to restore complete resistance [@lawley2012; @mcdonald2018]. This could be attributed to the complexity of the community and the mechanisms of colonization resistance [@ghimire2019; @auchtung2020]. We previously showed that when *C. difficile* colonizes different antibiotic-treated murine communities it modifies its metabolism to fit each specific environment [@schubert2015; @jenior2017; @jenior2018]. Therefore, we investigated the bacterial community dynamics concurrent with *C. difficile* elimination across uniquely perturbed communities.

Jenior et al. [@jenior2018] observed that clindamycin-treated mice spontaneously cleared *C. difficile* colonization whereas mice treated with cefoperazone and streptomycin did not. Here, we continued to explore the different effects these three antibiotics have on *C. difficile* colonization. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the gut bacterial community changes concurrent with elimination of *C. difficile* colonization. We hypothesized that each colonized community has perturbation-specific susceptibilities and requires specific changes to clear the pathogen. To induce a less severe perturbation, we reduced the doses of cefoperazone and streptomycin. This resulted in communities that were initially colonized to a high level (>$10^{6}$) and then spontaneously cleared. We found each antibiotic resulted in unique changes in the microbiota that were associated with the persistence or clearance of *C. difficile*. These data further support the hypothesis that *C. difficile* can exploit numerous niches in perturbed communities.



## Results

**Reduced doses of cefoperazone and streptomycin allowed communities to spontaneously clear *C. difficile* colonization.** To understand the dynamics of colonization and clearance of *C. difficile*, we first identified conditions which would allow colonization and clearance. Beginning with clindamycin, mice were treated with an intraperitoneal injection of clindamycin (10 mg/kg) one day prior to challenge with *C. difficile* (N = 11). All mice were colonized to a high level (median CFU = $3.07 \times 10^7$) the next day and cleared the colonization within 10 days; 6 mice cleared *C. difficile* within 6 days (Figure 1A). Previous *C. difficile* infection models using cefoperazone and streptomycin have not demonstrated clearance. So we next explored whether cefoperazone and streptomycin could permit colonization and subsequent clearance with lower doses. We began with replicating the previously established *C. difficile* infection models for these antibiotics [@jenior2018]. We treated mice with cefoperazone or streptomycin in their drinking water (0.5 mg/mL and 5 mg/mL, respectively) and then challenged them with *C. difficile*. For both antibiotics, *C. difficile* colonization was maintained for the duration of the experiment as previously demonstrated (Figure 1B-C) [@jenior2018]. Then we repeated the *C. difficile* challenge with reduced doses of the antibiotics (cefoperazone - 0.3 and 0.1 mg/mL; streptomycin - 0.5 and 0.1 mg/mL). For both antibiotic treatments, the lowest dose resulted in either no colonization (N = 8) or a transient, low level colonization (N = 8, median length = 1 day, median CFU/g = $2.8 \times 10^3$) (Figure 1B-C). The intermediate dose of both antibiotics resulted in a high level colonization (median CFU/g = $3.5 \times 10^6$) and half (N = 8 of 16) of the mice clearing the colonization within 10 days. Based on our previous research, which showed each of these antibiotics uniquely changed the microbiota, we hypothesize that the microbiota varied across these antibiotic treatments that resulted in colonization clearance.

**Clearance of *C. difficile* has associated with antibiotic-specific changes to the microbiota.** Beginning with the clindamycin-treated mice, we analyzed the 16S rRNA gene sequences to identify the community features related to *C. difficile* colonization and clearance. First, we compared the most abundant bacterial genera of the communities at the time of *C. difficile* challenge. The clindamycin-treated mice became dominated by relatives of *Enterobacteriaceae* with a concurrent reduction in the other top genera, except for populations of *Lactobacillus* (Figure 1D, S1). These community changes permitted *C. difficile* to colonize all of these mice but all were are also able to clear the colonization. We next investigated how the microbiota diversity related to *C. difficile* clearance. Clindamycin treatment decreased the alpha diversity (*P* < 0.05) and similarity to the pre-clindamycin community at the time of *C. difficile* challenge (*P* < 0.05) (Figure 2A). But it was not necessary to restore the community similarity to its initial state to clear *C. difficile*. Therefore we investigated the temporal differences in the abundance of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) between the initial untreated community and post-clindamycin treatment at the time of challenge and between the time of challenge and the end of the experiment. Clindamycin treatment resulted in large decreases in 21 OTUs and a bloom of relatives of *Enterobacteriaceae* (Figure 4A). With the elimination of *C. difficile*, we observed a drastic reduction of the relatives of *Enterobacteriaceae* and recovery of 10 populations related to *Porphyromonadaceae*, *Bacteroides*, *Akkermansia*, *Lactobacillus*, *Bifidobacterium*, *Lachnospiraceae*, and *Clostridiales* (Figure 4A). Thus, clindamycin reduced most of the natural community allowing *C. difficile* to colonize. The recovery of only a small portion of the community was associated with eliminating the *C.difficile* population.

We applied the same analysis to the cefoperazone-treated mice to understand what community features were relevant to clearing *C. difficile*. Increasing the dose of cefoperazone shifted the dominant community members from relatives of the *Porphyromonadaceae*, *Bacteroides* and *Akkermansia* to relatives of the *Lactobacillus* and *Enterobacteriaceae* at the time of challenge (Figure 1E, S1). We saw a similar increase in relatives of *Enterobacteriaceae* with clindamycin. However, the cefoperazone-treated mice that had larger increases in *Enterobacteriaceae* were unable to clear *C. difficile*. We next investigated the differences between the cefoperazone-treated mice that cleared *C. difficile* to those that did not. For the communities that cleared *C.difficile*, diversity was maintained through antibiotic treatment and at the end of the experiment with only slight decrease in alpha diversity and community similarity with antibiotic treatment (Figure 2B). The mice treated with cefoperazone that remained colonized experienced an increase in alpha diversity, likely driven by the decrease in highly abundant populations and increase in low abundant populations (Figure 1E). These persistently colonized communities also had a large shift away from the initial community structure with the antibiotic treatment (*P* < 0.05), which remained through the end of the experiment (*P* < 0.05) (Figure 2B). These data suggested that it was necessary for cefoperazone-treated mice to become more similar to the initial pre-antibiotic community structure to clear *C.difficile*. We next investigated the changes in OTU abundances between the communities that cleared *C. difficile* to those that did not to elucidate the community members involved in clearance. Communities that remained colonized were significantly enriched in facultative anaerobic populations including *Enterococcus*, *Pseudomonas*, *Staphylococcus* and *Enterobacteriaceae* at the time of challenge. Communities that cleared *C. difficile* had significant enrichment in 10 different OTUs related to the *Porphyromonadaceae* at the end of the experiment (Figure 3A). We also were interested in the temporal changes within each community so we investigated which OTUs changed due to antibiotic treatment or during the *C. difficile* colonization. The majority of significant temporal differences in OTUs for cefoperazone-treated mice occurred in persistently colonized communities. These communities had a loss of numerous relatives of the *Porphyromonadaceae*, increases in the facultative anaerobes differentiating the cefoperazone-treated mice by outcome, and no recovery of any of the reduced populations through the *C. difficile* challenge (Figure 4C, S2). Overall, persistent *C. difficile* colonization in cefoperazone-treated mice was associated with a shift in the microbiota to a new community structure which seemed unable to recover from the antibiotic perturbation, whereas clearance occurred when the community was capable of returning to its original structure.

Finally, we identified the differences in *C. difficile* colonization for streptomycin-treated mice. Increasing the dose of streptomycin maintained the abundance of relatives of the *Porphyromonadaceae* and *Bacteroides*, but reduced most of the other genera including populations of the *Lactobacillus*, *Lachnospiraceae*, *Ruminococcaceae*, *Alistipes*, and *Clostridiales* (Figure 1F). Both communities that cleared and those that remained colonized had similar changes in diversity. Streptomycin-treated mice became mildly dissimilar (*P* < 0.05) and less diverse (*P* < 0.05) with streptomycin treatment but returned to closely resemble the pre-antibiotic community at the end of the experiment (*P* < 0.05) (Figure 2C). Those communities that remained colonized had slightly lower alpha-diversity than those that cleared *C. difficile*. (*P* < 0.05). Persistently colonized mice had reduced relative abundance of relatives of *Alistipes*, *Anaeroplasma*, and *Porphyromonadaceae* at time of challenge compared to the mice that cleared *C. difficle* (Figure 3B). At the end of the experiment the mice still colonized had lower abundance of populations of *Turicibacter*, *Alistipes*, and *Lactobacillus*. Since most of the differences were reduced populations in the colonized mice, we were interested to explore what temporal changes occurred between pre-antibiotic treatment, the time of challenge, and the end of the experiment for the communities that cleared *C. difficile*. The temporal changes in streptomycin-treated mice were more subtle with fewer changes than the other antibiotic treatments. As expected based on the previous comparison, at the time of challenge the communities that remained colonization had reductions in 4 OTUs related to the *Porphyromonadaceae*. However, those that cleared *C. difficile* also had changes in OTUs related to the *Porphyromonadaceae*, 2 populations decreased and 2 increased in abundance (Figure 4B, D). At the end of the experiment, all communities experienced recovery of the abundance of many of the populations changed by the streptomycin treatment, but the communities that remained colonized did not recover 5 of the OTUs of *Alistipes*, *Lactobacillus*, and *Porphyromonadaceae* that were reduced by streptomycin. The differences between the streptomycin-treated mice that remained colonized and those had been cleared of *C. difficile* were not as distinct as in cefoperazone treatment. The differences between colonized and cleared streptomycin-treated mice were minimal, which suggested the few differences may be responsible for the clearance. Overall, these data revealed that while there were commonly affected families across the antibiotic treatments, such as *Porphyromonadaceae*, *C. difficile* clearance was associated with community and OTU differences specific to each antibiotic.

**Distinct features of the bacterial community at the time of infection predict end point colonization.** To determine whether the community composition at the time of *C. difficile* challenge could predict *C. difficile* clearance, we built a machine learning model using L~2~ Logistic Regression. We evaluated the predictive performance of the model using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), where a value of 0.5 indicated the model is random and 1.0 indicated the model always correctly predicts the outcome. Our model resulted in a AUROC of `r model_perf_median` [IQR `r model_perf_25`-`r model_perf_75`], which suggested that the model was able to use the relative abundance of OTUs at the time of challenge to accurately predict colonization clearance (Figure S3). To assess the important features, we randomly permuted each OTU feature by removing it from the training set to determine its effect on the prediction (Figure 5A). The most important feature was an OTU related to the *Enterobacteriaceae*, whose abundance predicted clearance. This result appears to be strongly driven by the clindamycin data (Figure 5B, C). The remaining OTU features did not have a large effect on the model performance, which suggested to us that most of the model decision was spread across many features. These results revealed the model used the relative abundance data of the community members and the relationship between those abundances to correctly classify clearance. There were many OTUs with treatment and outcome specific abundance patterns that did not agree with the odds ratio of the OTU used by the model. For example, *Enterobacteriaceae* abundance influenced the model to predict clearance (Figure 5B), however in experiments that used cefoperazone, the communities that remained colonized had higher abundances of *Enterobacteriaceae* than the communities that cleared colonization (Figure 5C). The model arrived at the correct prediction through the influence of other OTUs. Therefore, the model used different combinations of multiple OTUs and their relative abundances across treatments to predict *C. difficile* clearance. These data can offer a basis for hypotheses regarding the distinct combinations of bacteria that promote *C. difficile* clearance.

**Conditional independence networks reveal treatment-specific relationships between the community members and *C. difficile* during colonization clearance.** We next investigated the relationship between temporal changes in the community and *C. difficile* by building a conditional independence network for each treatment using SPIEC-EASI (sparse inverse covariance estimation for ecological association inference) [@kurtz2015]. First, we focused on the first-order associations of *C. difficile* (Figure 6A). In clindamycin-treated mice, *C. difficile* had positive associations with relatives of *Enterobacteriaceae*, *Pseudomonas*, and *Olsenella* and negative associations with relatives of the *Lachnospiraceae* and *Clostridium* XIVa. *C. difficile* had limited associations in cefoperazone-treated mice; the primary association was positive with relatives of *Enterobacteriaceae*. In streptomycin-treated mice, *C. difficile* had negative associations with relatives of the *Porphyromonadaceae* and positive associations with populations of the *Ruminococcaceae*, *Bacteroidetes*, *Clostridium* IV and *Olsenella*. Next, we quantified the degree centrality, the number of associations between each OTU for the whole network of each antibiotic and outcome, and betweenness centrality, the number of associations connecting two OTUs that pass through an OTU (Figure 6B). This analysis revealed cefoperazone treatment resulted in networks primarily composed of singular associations with much lower degree centrality (*P* < 0.05) and betweenness centrality (*P* < 0.05) than the other antibiotic treatments. Communities that were treated with cefoperazone that resulted in cleared or persistent colonization had 10 to 100-fold lower betweenness centrality values than communities treated with clindamycin or streptomycin. Collectively, these networks suggest *C. difficile* colonization was affected by unique sets of OTUs for mice treated with clindamycin and streptomycin, but cefoperazone treatment eliminated bacteria critical to maintain the community interactions and had few populations that associated with *C. difficile*.



## Discussion




Previous studies have identified microbiota-based features associated *C. difficile* colonization resistance in either a set of closely related murine communities or collectively across many different susceptible communities. The bacteria identified were then tested in *C. difficile* infection models. However, those experiments were unable to restore colonization resistance to the susceptible communities [@lawley2012; @reeves2012]. Rather than looking for commonalities across all susceptible communities, we explored the changes that associated with *C. difficile* clearance for each antibiotic. Even though these mice all came from the same colony and began with closely related communities, *C. difficile* clearance was associated with antibiotic-specific changes in microbiota diversity, OTU abundances and associations. These data suggest that the set of bacteria necessary to restore colonization resistance to one community perturbation may not be effective for all perturbations. Further investigation into the specific mechanisms clearing *C. difficile* will elucidate the niches *C. difficile* utilizes and inform interventions to clear the colonization.

In this study we have shown antibiotic treatment resulted in specific changes in the microbiota associated with *C. difficile* clearance. Clindamycin-treated mice were susceptible with a dominant bloom in populations related to *Enterobacteriaceae*. Clearance was associated with the resolving bloom and recovery of bacteria reduced by the antibiotic treatment. Therefore, the clindamycin-treated mice may naturally restore colonization resistance within a short time period. A greater delay between clindamycin treatment and *C. difficile* challenge may allow sufficient recovery of the microbiota to prevent colonization. Cefoperazone-treated mice became susceptible with the expansion of numerous populations of facultative anaerobes. Those communities with the sustained presence of the facultative anaerobes were were unable to recovery from the initial antibiotic perturbation or clear the colonization, whereas the communities that were able to return to resemble their initial community were able to clear *C. difficile* colonization. Streptomycin-treated mice were susceptible with minor changes in diversity and few OTUs with relative abundance changes or differences between communities that remained colonization or cleared *C. difficile*. This susceptibility may be driven by the loss of a few critical bacteria. Many of the bacterial population abundances that sugnificantly changed during the experiment were populations related to the *Porphyromonadaceae* and communities that cleared colonization maintained more populations related to the *Porphyromonadaceae*. This observation led us to the hypothesis that multiple populations related to the *Porphyromonadaceae* are necessary to clear *C. difficile*. Colonization resistance could potentially be restored through returning the diversity of the *Porphyromonadaceae* family. Thus, each antibiotic treatment resulted in different bacterial changes associated with the ability to clear *C. difficile*.

While we have described antibiotic treatment-specific changes, our observations are not expected to directly transfer to human studies [@hugenholtz2017; @wrzosek2018]. Murine gut communities differ by their care facility and even greater from human gut communities [@nagpal2018; @osbelt2020; @velazquez2019]. Therefore, we looked to understand the general trends as opposed to the experiment-specific events. We categorized the general changes and microbial relationships of these experiments into three scenarios. (i) Limited opportunity - a transient dominance by a facultative anaerobe permits *C. difficile* colonization but quickly recovers and *C. difficile* is not able to persist, as with clindamycin treatment. We hypothesize this susceptibility is due to a transient repression of the community and interventions which further perturb the community may worsen the infection. Time alone may be sufficient for the community to clear colonization but treating the community with an antibiotic or the preparation for an FMT may create new susceptibilities by eliminating protective functions or opening new nutrient niches. Intervention in this scenario could lead to increased susceptibility, allowing *C. difficile* to spread to other niches and prolong the infection. This susceptibility may be characterized by a disappearing facultative anaerobe bloom. (ii) Specific opportunity - a perturbation only affects a select portion of the microbiota, leading to minor relative abundance changes and a slight decrease in diversity, opening a limited specific niche for *C. difficile* to colonize, as with streptomycin treatment. We hypothesize a few specific bacteria would be necessary to recolonize the exposed niche and eliminate *C. difficile* colonization. A fecal microbiota transplant may contain the bacterial diversity to overlap the missing community members and seed the necessary bacteria to clear *C. difficile* from the exposed niche of the colonized community. (iii) Extensive opportunity - a significant perturbation occurs leading to a persistent increase in facultative anaerobes and exposing multiple niches, as with cefoperazone treatment. These communities appear to have been severely depleted of community members and are likely lacking numerous protective functions. We hypothesize in this scenario multiple niches are available for *C. difficile* to colonize. In this scenario, a full FMT may be insufficient to providing adequate diversity and abunadance to outcompete and occupy all the exposed niches. Multiple FMTs or transplant of an enriched fecal community may be necessary to recover the microbiota enough to outcompete *C. difficile* for the nutrient niches and replace the missing protective functions. Analyzing each of these colonization scenarios individually allows us to understand each may have different requirements to from an intervention.

Based on these observations, future investigations can further elucidate the exposed niches of susceptible communities and the requirements to clear *C. difficile* colonization. One common theme for susceptibility across treatments was increased facultative anaerobe abundance. This increase could be investigated for its ability to predict community susceptibility to *C. difficile* colonization. The facultative anaerobe blooms could be attributed to the loss of oxygen level suppression by obligate anaerobes with antibiotic treatment [@winter2013; @riverachavez2017]. However, it is unclear what prevents the succession from facultative anaerobes back to obligate anaerobes, such as with cefoperazone-treated mice. Future studies should investigate the relationship between facultative anaerobe blooms and susceptibility to colonization and interventions to recover the obligate anaerobes. Additionally, our observations may be strain specific. Other strains may have different genetic capabilities and community interactions [@carlson2013]. For example, more virulent strains, like *C. difficile* VPI 10463, may have a greater effect on the gut environment since it produces more toxin [@lawley2012; @rao2015]. Those differences could impact the susceptible community and change the requirements to clear *C. difficile*. Finally, previously we have shown community functions at peak colonization are antibiotic-specific [@jenior2018] and here we have shown the changes associated with *C. difficile* clearance are antibiotic-specific but it is unknown how the community functions contributing to *C. difficile* clearance compare across antibiotics. Examining the changes in transcription and metabolites during clearance will help define the necessary activities to clear *C. difficile*. Building upon the information presented in this study will elucidate how the microbiota clears *C. difficile* colonization.

Here we have shown murine microbiota became susceptible to *C. difficile* colonization after three different antibiotic treatments and then subsequently cleared the colonization. These sets of experiments have shown each antibiotic treatment resulted in different community changes associated with *C. difficile* clearance. This difference suggests that one treatment for all *C. difficile* infections may not be appropriate. While our current use of FMT to eliminate recurrent CDI is highly effective, it does not work in all patients and has even resulted in adverse consequences [@juul2018; @seekatz2014; @patron2017; @defilipp2019]. The findings in this study may help explain why FMTs may be ineffective. While the FMT is transplanting a whole community, it may not be sufficiently replacing community members or functions to inhibit *C. difficile* or the FMT procedure itself maybe disrupting the natural recovery of the community. Additionally, this study demonstrates a method to improve our understanding of how the bacterial community responds to *C. difficile* colonization. The knowledge of how a community clears *C. difficile* colonization will advance our ability to develop targeted therapies to manage CDI.



## Materials and Methods

**Animal care.** All mice were obtained from a single breeding colony and maintained in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) conditions at the University of Michigan animal facility. All mouse protocols and experiments were approved by the University Committee on Use and Care of Animals at the University of Michigan and completed in agreement with approved guidelines.

**Antibiotic administration.** Mice were given one of three antibiotics, cefoperazone, clindamycin, or streptomycin. Cefoperazone (0.5, 0.3, or 0.1 mg/ml) and streptomycin (5, 0.5, or 0.1 mg/ml) were delivered via drinking water for 5 days. Clindamycin (10 mg/kg) was administered through intraperitoneal injection.

** *C. difficile* challenge.** Mice were returned to untreated drinking water for 24 hours before challenging with *C. difficile* strain 630$\Delta$erm spores. *C. difficile* spores were aliquoted from a single spore stock stored at 4$^\circ$C. Spore concentration was determined one week prior to the day of challenge [@sorg2009]. $10^{3}$ *C. difficile* spores were orally gavaged into each mouse. Once the gavages were completed, the remaining spore solution was serial diluted and plated to confirm accurate spore concentration was delivered.

**Sample collection.** Fecal samples were collected on the day antibiotic treatment was started, on the day of *C. difficile* challenge and the following 10 days. For the day of challenge and beyond, a fecal sample was also collected and weighed. Then under anaerobic conditions a fecal sample was serial diluted in anaerobic phosphate-buffered saline and plated on TCCFA plates. After 24 hours of anaerobic incubation at 37$^\circ$C CFU were enumerated [@winston2016].

**DNA sequencing.** Total bacterial DNA was extracted from each fecal sample using MOBIO PowerSoil-htp 96-well soil DNA isolation kit. We created amplicons of the 16s rRNA gene V4 region and sequenced them using an Illumina MiSeq as described previously [@kozich2013].

**Sequence curation.** Sequences were processed using mothur(v.1.43.0) as previously described [@kozich2013, @schloss2009]. Briefly, we used a 3% dissimilarity cutoff to group sequences into operational taxonomic units (OTUs). We used a naive Bayesian classifier with the Ribosomal Database Project training set (version 16) to assign taxonomic classifications to each OTU [@wang2007]. With the fecal samples, we also sequenced a mock community with a known community composition and their true 16s rRNA gene sequences. We processed this mock community along with our samples to determine our sequence curation resulted in an error rate of 0.019%.

**Statistical analysis and modeling.** Diversity comparisons were calculated in mothur. To compare within community diversity, we calculated Sobs and Inverse Simpson. To compare across communities, we calculated dissimilarity matrices based on metric of Yue and Clayton [@yue2005]. Samples were rarified to 1,200 sequences per sample within calculating the distance matrices to ensure no biases remained due to uneven sampling. OTUs were subsampled to 1,200 counts per sample and remaining statistical analysis and data visualization was performed in R (v3.5.1) with the tidyverse package (v1.3.0). Significance of pairwise comparisons of $\alpha$-diversity (S~obs~ and Inverse Simpson), $\beta$-diversity ($\theta$~YC~), OTU abundance, and network centrality (betweenness and degree) were calculated by pairwise Wilcoxon rank sum test and then *P* values were corrected for multiple comparisons with a Benjamini and Hochberg adjustment for a type I error rate of 0.05 [@benjamini1995]. Logistic regression models were constructed with OTUs from all day 0 samples using half of the samples to train and the other half to test the model. The model was developed from the caret R package (v6.0-85) and previously developed machine learning pipeline [@topcuoglu2020]. Conditional independence networks were calculated using SPIEC-EASI (sparse inverse covariance estimation for ecological association inference) methods from the SpiecEasi R package after optimizing lambda to 0.001 with a network stability between 0.045 and 0.05 (v1.0.7) [@kurtz2015].

**Figure 2. Microbiota community diversity showed antibiotic-specific trends associated with *C. difficle* colonization clearance** For clindamycin (A), cefoperazone (B), and streptomycin (C), microbiota $\alpha$-diversity (S~obs~ and Inverse Simpson) and $\beta$-diversity ($\theta$~YC~) were compared at the initial pre-antibiotic treatment state, time of *C. difficile* challenge (TOC), and end of the experiment. $\beta$-diversity ($\theta$~YC~) was compared between the initial pre-antibiotic treatment state relative and all other initial pre-antibiotic treatment communities treated with the same antibitoic, the initial community to the same community at the time of *C. difficile* challenge, and the initial community to the same community at end of the experiment. (clindamycin - cleared N = 11; cefoperazone - cleared N = 7, colonized N = 9; streptomycin - cleared N = 9, colonized N = 11). Points for communities no longer colonized with *C. difficile* are unfilled. Points for communities that were still colonized are filled in. * indicates statistical significance of *P* < 0.05, calculated by Wilcoxon rank sum test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction.

**Figure 3. OTU abundance differences between communities that cleared *C. difficile* colonization and remained colonized are unique to each treatment** For cefoperazone (A) and streptomycin (B), the difference in the relative abundance of OTUs that are significantly different between communities that eliminated *C. difficile* colonization and those that remained colonized within each antibiotic treatment for each time point. Unfilled circles show samples that cleared *C. difficile* and filled circles show samples that remained colonized. Initial points - green; TOI points - blue; End points - red. Lines connect points by OTU within each comparison to show difference in medians. Only plotted OTUs at time points which differences were statistically significant, *P* < 0.05, and calculated by Wilcoxon rank sum test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction. Bold points are median relative abundance and transparent points are relative abundance of individual mice. Limit of detection (LOD).

**Figure 4. Each antibiotic had specific sets of temporal changes in OTU abundance associated with *C. difficile* colonization and clearance** For clindamycin (A), cefoperazone (C), and streptomycin (B, D), the difference in the relative abundance of OTUs that are significantly different communities between time points within each *C. difficile* colonization outcome for each antibiotic treatment. Initial points - green; TOI points - blue; End points - red. Arrows point in the direction of the temporal change of the relative abundance. Lines connect points by OTU within each comparison to show difference in medians. Bold OTUs were shared across comparisons. Only plotted OTUs at time points which differences were statistically significant, *P* < 0.05, and calculated by Wilcoxon rank sum test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction. Bold points are median relative abundance and transparent points are relative abundance of individual mice. Limit of detection (LOD).

**Figure 5. Distinct features of the bacterial community at the time of infection can classify end point colonization** (A) L~2~ logistic regression model feature importances determined by the negative effect randomizing an individual feature has on the model performance. All OTUs affecting performance shown. Gray column shows performance range of final model with all features included. (B) Distibution of odds ratio used in L~2~ logistic regression model. Values above 1 indicated abundance predicted the community cleared colonization (red) and values below 1 indicated abundance predicted *C. difficile* remained colonized (blue). Feature label and boxplot colored to match the median odds ratio. (C) Relative abundance difference in features used by L~2~ logistic regression model faceted by antibiotic treatment. Red boxplot - antibiotic-treated mice that were no longer colonized; Blue boxplot - antibiotic-treated mice that remained colonized. Boxplot shows median - horizontal bar, quartile range - box, range of non-outlier data - whiskers, data greater than 1.5 times the interquartile range - points.
